	<p>Canada has always been successful in the olympics compared to other countries. However, especially in recent years by winning a lot of medals in the world has managed to enter the top three. The fact that gold medals have more than %50 in the table is an indication of this. </p>

		<p>After the 2000s, we observe an increase in medals earned by women. This can be attributed to increase in women's contribution to sports. In some periods, it can be interpreted that almost half of all earned medals belong to women.</p>

		<p>The number of medals won by men has been balanced and loyal to the average for many years. But there has been a noticeable increase in the last 30 years. This is one of the important factors that placed Canada in the top 3 in the world.</p>

		<p>When we compare it to the total number of medals, we have a really good graphic. As soon as women start appearing in the Olympics, they bring great success.</p>

		<p>Although there was an obvious drop in the number of gold medals between the 60s and 90s, men managed to fill the gap with their performance after 90s. With these 4 specific graphs, it is not hard to say that most of Canada's success has been achieved in the last 30 years, with the participation of women. </p>
